Tne virtual labs feedback service has the following main functions:

 - 1. Provides online feedback forms to students doing virtual lab experiments. 

 - 2.  Provide a way for a lab instructor/nodal centre coordinator to access
   the forms and get informaiton about workshop usage.

 - 3. Provide analytics about feedback (e.g., how many users answered "yes" to
   a particular question, etc.)


The filling of a feedback form by student results in a feedback instance.   The
instance has the following information: 
  - 1.  The date and time when the feedback was submitted.
  - 2.  The IP address of the machine from where feedback was submitted.
  - 3.  The user id of the user filling the form.
  - 4.  The name of the lab and the experiment for which feedback is being
    given.

  - 5.  A set of responses.  Each response is a pair of question and an answer.  

  - 6.  A question  is of the following different types:

        + 1. Multiple choice 
        + 2. Radio Buttons
        + 3. Text
