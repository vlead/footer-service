* Introduction 
  This document describes all the requirements of =footer
  service=. 

* Requirements

** Requirement 1
   The main motivation is to provide footer as a service
   which should serve the Virtual Labs landing page footer  
   as it is. The footer service would render the footer
   dynamically instead of building/updating the static html
   pages every time. 

** Requirement 2
   Irrespective of the system resolution as well as the
   accesibility of Virtual Labs site on multiple
   devices/platforms, the footer should be responsive.
